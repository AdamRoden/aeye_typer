# Fast AEye TypeR

An accessibility tool (WIP) attempting to allow hands free mouse and keyboard use via an eye-tracker and wearable bran-scanner.

This tool differs from existing solutions in that

* It is inteded for use in a linux environment
* The rate of typing is intended to be on par with a proficient typist's WPM rate.
*  Use is based on eye movement and thought alone - i.e. a completely paralyzed but fully conscious person may use it.

## Ideas

"Symbol" mode (e.g. 'if', 'else') versus "Key" mode (e.g. 'i', 'f', 'e', 'l', 's', 'e')
