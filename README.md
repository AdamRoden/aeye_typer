# Fast AEye TypeR

An accessibility tool (WIP) attempting to allow hands free mouse and keyboard use via an eye-tracker and wearable bran-scanner.

This tool differs from existing solutions in that

* It is inteded for use in a linux environment
* The rate of typing is intended to be on par with a proficient typist's WPM rate.
*  Use is based on eye movement and thought alone - i.e. a completely paralyzed but fully conscious person may use it.

# What's in a name?

Fast AEye TypeR is named after it's creator, Dustin Fast <dustin.fast@hotmail.com>. "TypeR" is the word "typer", but the last letter is capitalized as a nod to his adventurous spirit, embodied by his car -- a Honda Civic Type R.

## Ideas

"Symbol" mode (e.g. 'if', 'else') versus "Key" mode (e.g. 'i', 'f', 'e', 'l', 's', 'e')
